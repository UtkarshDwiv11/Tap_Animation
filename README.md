Tap Animation
This is a Flutter project that demonstrates how to create a simple tap animation. The animation involves expanding a blue box from the bottom of a circle when the circle is tapped.

Getting Started
To run this project, you will need to have the Flutter SDK installed on your machine. If you do not have it installed, you can download it from the Flutter website.

Project Structure
The project has the following structure:

lib/
|- main.dart

main.dart is the main file that runs the project.

Key Classes and Widgets
The following classes and widgets are important in this project:

MyApp: A StatelessWidget that returns a MaterialApp widget with a Scaffold as the home page.
Tap: A StatefulWidget that displays the tap animation.
_TapState: The state of the Tap widget, which contains the animation logic.
AnimationController: A class that controls the animation.
Animation: A class that represents an animation.
Tween: A class that defines the range of values that an animation can take.
Stack: A widget that allows stacking of children widgets.
Positioned: A widget that positions its children relative to the edges of the box.
GestureDetector: A widget that detects gestures.
AnimatedBuilder: A widget that rebuilds whenever the animation changes.


Functionality
The project uses the following logic to implement the tap animation:

The animation is controlled by an AnimationController object.
The animation is defined by a Tween object that specifies the start and end values of the animation.
The animation is triggered by tapping a circle. When the circle is tapped, the AnimationController object's forward method is called to start the animation, and the reverse method is called to stop it.
The expanding blue box is built using an AnimatedBuilder widget that updates its height and width based on the animation's value.


Conclusion
This project provides a simple example of how to create a tap animation in Flutter. It demonstrates the use of AnimationController, Animation, Tween, Stack, Positioned, GestureDetector, and AnimatedBuilder widgets to create a dynamic user interface.
